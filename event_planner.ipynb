      "So, get ready to dive into the future of social media and discover the platforms of social media that are predicted to revolutionize the industry.\n",
      "1. Threads:\n",
      "Threads, the explosive sensation of 2023, has disrupted the social media world with an impressive user base of 131 million. Born in Los Angeles, this platform is reshaping the rules of online interactions.\n",
      "Threads isn’t merely a platform; it’s an experience that empowers users to reclaim control over their conversations. With groundbreaking features such as a redesigned way to view liked threads and the ability to add custom alt-text to images and videos, it’s innovation at its best.\n",
      "2. Clubhouse:\n",
      "Clubhouse, the audio-chat social app, has over 28 million downloads worldwide. With innovative features like chat moderation, rooms, events, and exclusive clubs, it is always at the forefront of social interaction.\n",

      "6. Damus\n",
      "Built upon the foundation of Nostr, the open and decentralized social networking protocol, Damus is also a decentralized social media platform. It shares messages via encrypted relays.\n",

Lemon8 made its debut in Japan in 2020 and subsequently expanded to the United Kingdom and the United States in February 2023.\n",
      "8. Patreon\n",
      "Patreon is a platform that allows creators to build a direct relationship with their fans and supporters. Creators can offer their fans exclusive content, such as early access to new episodes, behind-the-scenes footage, and merchandise discounts. Fans can then choose to support their favorite creators on a monthly basis.\n",
      "Its popularity has lured the creators to join the platform in order to reach new audiences.\n",
      "In the last 3 years, more than 50,000 creators have joined the platform.\n",
      "9. Discord\n",
      "Discord is a chat app that is perfect for gamers, communities, and anyone who wants to connect with others online. It is easy to use and allows you to create and join servers for all sorts of interests.\n",
      "Discord servers can be used for gaming, chatting, sharing files, and more. You can also create private servers for your friends and family, or join public servers for specific interests.\n",
      "By the start of this year, Discord was estimated to have over 560 million users worldwide. With such a user base, it is definitely one of the most popular social media platforms to watch out for in 2023.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",

Take a hard look at what your event’s needs will be when planning in this unique and quirky city.

But before you sign the dotted line of that contract, have a few items on your event checklist ironed out:\n",
      "Event tone. As stated above, tone is everything. The tenor you provide for your meeting or affair will lean into your event’s objective. \n",
      "Event budget. This is a big one, so be certain to ask all the right questions. Know what is included in your venue rental fee, and what you’ll need to outsource. Some spots have it all there, while others are truly an empty space you’ll need to fill. \n",
      "Event tech. Ask your venue what audio/visual tech they have in-house, or use their resources to find a partner. If you are planning for experiential elements, be certain your space has the rigging and tech you need. \n",
      "Event format. Presentations. Breakout sessions. Training. Product rollouts. There are many things on your event’s agenda, so be certain the venue you select has the means to aid in your event’s flow. \n",
      "Event safety. As the professional you are, you’ve adapted to the unique times, but there are always considerations when bringing a large group of people together. Does your venue have lots of space so everyone feels comfortable and distanced? What’s the plan if there’s an emergency? Is it ADA compliant?\n",

      "You, you will have to choose eventually between like what you want your metadata data to be as far as how trolls get labeled. And what the moderation you want is. They're basically the way they are gonna offboard moderation is very similar to maam, right? You're gonna leave it up to individuals. They go through and label like, we approve this person. This is a troll, this is a harasser. This person is banned. And you can subscribe to whichever one you find best. So I think that when it comes to Blue Sky, it's a really, really, really great conversation right now. I don't think it's gonna be a great conversation a year from now with the approach that they're taking to moderation. In my view,\n",

It is the community you create. Yes. It is. Not anybody can put up a nice little white sheet that random people can comment on.

And they, they say the same, same thing about full Tech search, which I think is actually pretty foolish. He Macedon changing his mind on both. Yeah, he's gonna have to Right on.

      "Gotta, I gotta give people a crib sheet. Orgon is the creator of Macedon. Mastodon does not stand alone on, sits on a protocol called activity Pub which many other apps use as well. And Activity Pub is, is the backbone of something called the Fed Averse, which is a federated universe of social apps, which include Pixel Fed, which is for pictures. There's a Peer tube, which is a, a YouTube clone. So there are a variety of things that use this activity. Pub Blue Skies following the same road. In fact, it was a little weird. Jack Dorsey gave them I think 10 million a couple of years ago to start as a public benefit corporation. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> not owned by Twitter. Jack is on the board fully independent, but it's fully independent. So again, it's a public benefit corporation. And his walking papers, his mandate was create a federated Twitter, something decentralized that no one can own. And he was kind of prescient. Actually, the most interesting story about Blue Sky this week is Eject Dorsey went on Blue Sky to retract his, his statements about Elon Musk. When Elon first bought Twitter, he said the push best possible person to own it.\n",

And I get it. I love Mastodon. I've got 15,000 people there. My engagement is roughly equal to what I get on Twitter with 10 times that amount. I enjoy Mass Chaan. I think what you're seeing with Blue Sky is not just this ephemeral love for it because it is invite only. I think the reality is a ton of people that are just at their wits end with harassment have moved over to Blue Sky and have made it their home. And I think it doesn't take, I think there's a critical mass of journalists that can leave Twitter and make Blue Sky their home and start posting there. That's going to have a really negative impact on you know, Twitter as a a vehicle to experience news actively.\n",

      "Alex Stamos (00:11:55):\n",
      "The trolls have not been for the most part. So Blue Sky invite codes are going for like 300 bucks on day. Yeah. So, you know, it's a big investment to go buy a invite code and then go burn it after just to get a couple of nasty right. Tweets at you. Right. but structurally there's nothing about Blue Sky that makes it better than Mastodon. In fact, I would say, I mean, activity Pub there has a longer history of the at protocol and people have been working on it in both cases, Mastodon and Blue Sky, people have not figured out how are you gonna do moderation in a distributed fashion. Right? Like the, the protocols themselves don't do a lot about the kind of metadata around moderation that is actually used inside of the big companies. And if you're a maid on owner right now, moderation's a big pain in the butt. And the tools do not really exist to do almost anything from an automated perspective. And so I I think yes, it feels a little better right now. It's because the trolls have bought their blue checks on Twitter and they're running rampant on Twitter. But there's absolutely nothing that says that you won't end up with fully abusive instances federating with Blue Sky, just as you've had with Mastodon.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (00:12:58):\n",
      "The good news on Mastodon is whoever runs the instance, and I run a Mastodon instance called twit.social. Right. Has kind of infinite control to moderate it. You don't have the tools, but I, with a small instance like mine, it's, it's about five or 6,000 people. I rely on the users to report mm-hmm. <Affirmative> when they report, I review and I Boo Boot 'em. Usually that's no more than a few a day. And it's invite only so you have to apply to get in and it's not invite Exactly. It's, but you have to apply to get in. You're approved approval. Yeah. And so it hasn't been an issue. Yeah. and then we also, so, and then I also have to remind users, you can block anybody on Macedon, which is nice. Block 'em on any instance, anywhere you as a user can block any instance.\n",
      "(00:13:41):\n",
      "Yep. And as an administrator, I can block an instance. So if there is an instance, and there are quite a few unmasted on, that's a, there are nasty Nazi incidents instances, or that's hard to say. Nazi instances you can block them whole hog, which I do. Yeah. and so, so right now if you're on twit social, your experience is probably very benign. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe not on masks, on social, one of the big instances. Right. But that's the argument for Federation of Small Instances. Right. That can be handled by individuals and moderators. Right.\n",

What's really interesting that I've noticed, and in my long experience of two days on blue Sky, is that black Twitter has adopted Blue Sky far more than Mastodon. Yep. that's good. I think it was\n",
      "Leo Laporte (00:14:41):\n",
      "A very smart, I mean, that's not good for Mastodon, but I'm glad that they've found out that, that, that there's a home. Well,\n",
      "Jeff Jarvis (00:14:45):\n",
      "We'll see. But it was a smart thing where the devs valued that and they, and they found some people to give the invites to, to give the invites to the people who matter. And, and there's a lot of people there Cade's there. Dr. Ray is there. A lot of folks are there who were not on Mastadon. And Mastadon didn't give the best reception. When I held the black Twitter summit in February you know, one of the things we talked about was that the geeks of Bas Don said to black Twitter, well, these are our rules and make your own instance. And, and, and, and it was their way to say F you to a community. They weren't valuing sufficiently. So we'll see what happens on Blue Sky, but it's, I think, a very positive sign because the, you can make I think a very good argument that the social things that work are the ones that are pushed into new uses by communities like black Twitter.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (00:15:42):\n",
      "If I channel the founders of Blue Sky, and I'll let you respond to this, Alex, they said, well, we've gotta solve the issues of distributed id. We've gotta solve these issues of federation before we start putting in moderation tools before we start putting in blocking. Because of course, if you don't have a solid framework for federation, then you don't even know what blocking means is blocking local is blocking federated. How do you federated put this up? Yeah. And so one of the things they, they have done that is I think probably better, their protocol is called at Proto. One of the things they have done better is it's, it's very easily portable. Your identity on blue sky. Mines Leo laport me. It doesn't say blue sky. And I can easily move that because it's a, it's a public key crypto. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> backed d i d to another instance if I don't like an instance. So I think that it, that, you know, it mask on. You can move, but it's a manual process. It's not\n",

That you see, if you look at admin block or feta block hashtags and Macedon, it is full of people turning their little personal fights into folks into blocking entire instances. And then mm-hmm. <Affirmative> hundreds or thousands of people complaining, why can't I follow my friends anymore? Because these two people, and then also well-meaning people who, who are trying to run communities that are open and helpful and that don't have the kind of CC on Twitter are being driven away from hosting Macedon because of the, the abuse they get if they, if they slightly deviate from Right.

I kind of wish the blue sky folks had taken my class because this is exactly why I teach a class at Stanford, is you should not be launching any kind of social product without having done a lot of the basic stuff. It just feels blue sky. They've launched, they're probably, I think they've launched six months early based upon what's going on.\n",

      "Leo Laporte (00:18:12):\n",

      "Alex Stamos (00:18:14):\n",
      "Well, what happened is the invite only wasn't working. The reason all this abuse came up is the initial invites didn't have enough entropy. Oh. And so you ha and it looks like there's no rate limiting on the api. Ah, so you had trolls just brute forcing in the invites and then w walking themselves in so they didn't have to really burn anything of consequence to go abuse people. So yes, I, I think there's a, a number of interesting security and, and safety issues in blue sky. But in the long run, even if they build out a team, w how do you do community management of rules in a federated world is going to be a fascinating problem. I also think we're going to need better tools for folks because our team's doing a bunch of work on this. I, I don't wanna preview it too much, but we'll be publishing a paper probably in two, three weeks from now where we talk about child safety issues on Macedon. And it's a really serious issue. Oh boy. It's a serious issue that asks Alex that you have to think about if you are a Macedon you owner. Yeah. Because when your people subscribe to other folks content, that content gets pulled down and stored on your server.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (00:19:10):\n",
      "Yeah. We should explain how this works. So here's my masin on instance, there's a number of timelines. There's the local timeline, which is just people posting on TWI social. There's the people I follow, kind of like your normal Twitter timeline. But there's this federated timeline. This is a timeline of everybody followed by anybody on my server. Yeah. Which means if somebody on my server follows an ins somebody that has child porn, that is now on my server,\n",
      "Alex Stamos (00:19:34):\n",

      "If, if I could just chime in on here for a second. Yes. I really wanna back up what you're saying, Alex. And I think that is the fundamental flaw that I see with Blue Sky, because their vision of the future is someone who does not have any resources behind them from Blue Sky. Someone apparently is going to go out there, they're gonna be writing all this metadata that you or I or some user can subscribe to, to basically put a label on users and put a label on activity. Like put a label on skits. Right? This is not funded. And I was talking you know, I was talking to the former head of Twitter trust and safety about this yesterday on, on Blue Sky where, you know, this is incredibly expensive work to do correctly. This is the entire reason Elon Musk has like, automated a lot of this because it is so expensive to do trust and safety.\n",
      "(00:21:20):\n",
      "Well, you do have to have oversight. You have to have transparency. You have to have the ability to appeal. Right. so this is the part of it that I am deeply, deeply, deeply skeptical with Blue Sky. I mean, I suppose theoretically that you get enough users over there, enough of the, you know, major users of Twitter and someone comes along and they offer to do trust and safety as a product that I can subscribe to for $8 a month. Maybe that works. Like I could kind of see that working, but it's just their, their entire paradigm here in my view, is solving the wrong problem. What I do think they've done right, is they've gotten all the right people from Twitter off Twitter talking to each other on this service, enjoying what it's like to have a conversation without endless harassment and death threats with adults there. And we're really getting emotionally invested in it. So, you know, maybe they can turn the ship around by share Alex's appraisal that this is work, this should have been done, you know, six months ago. And really ideally prior to the M V P.\n",

They're gonna have quote tweets to be able to do that. And they're, and that blocking is gonna be fairly limited. And so how, with no staff, how does Lou Sky and, and very importantly, how does the community of Blue Sky react? How do we, well, who do we, who do we report to? What do we do?

So if you have a place with a critical mass of those journalists to talk about this stuff, that is something Blue sky can definitely become the home up. So Twitter doesn't have to get all the, like Twitter doesn't have to hemorrhage all their users. They just have to hemorrhage the most important power users and, and tons of\n",

So one of the reasons Twitter was good is so that you could see the, what people were saying about the slap, not just journalists. You could see what the zeitgeist was, what people were saying then. So that's one thing. Then there's also the, the important, important voices. The, the, the, the, I don't know what the VA verified voices. That's another thing. People aren't leaving Twitter or are they mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, some verified voices have, I mean, that's what happened this week in Blue Sky was a lot of well-known people said, that's it, I'm done. Right. If, if, if all of the, but I also noticed a O c Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the member of Congress from New York was on Blue Sky. But she said, but this is my personal account because I can't move my account as a o C rep, a o c over yet my government account over yet it's still on Twitter.

There's the positive identity is this Leo Laport who's saying this?

But, but I think they have a better chance than average. So if they did want to win in the long run, Alex, I'd really love to know your opinion here. This is what I think they need to do. I know they wanna do the master done thing where like you add some metadata to your server and like verify yourself that way. I think this is a losing idea. I think they should just commit to like identifying and manually reviewing and re-verifying everybody that was formally verified at Twitter. I think especially going into an election, I think that would be a huge draw for all of those users.\n",

Hours of the day they want us over there. Right. So I think that's the first thing. The second thing is, look, I understand that Jack and like, you know, Jay and the crypto people, they've got this idea for like a, a federated you know like modular idea to harassment and trust and safety. If they're gonna stick with that, I think at the very least they need to invest in a very strong default option that they themselves are funding.

      "Right. That's a good point. And that, that does bring in lots of other people. I I think Brianna's plan is good. I I think one B Sky is going to have to have the, the main kind of B sky.app. They're gonna have to do trust and safety. They cannot wash their hands and say we're distributed and it's not our, our responsibility. And second, you, somebody's gonna have to step and, and do verification. Verification is expensive, right? So to to take photographs of people's IDs and to say, this account belongs to this in real life person. Either you have to pay a decent amount of money and I think it's like something like three to $4 per account that you're trying to get verified through a service or you have to build that in-house or buy it. When I was at Facebook, we bought a company that did ML verification of identifiers. And that was like, I think a 400 million or something purchase in that, in that range, right? So somebody's going to have to do that and, but I think people who do that are going to be in a good place for the next couple of years.\n",

And, and, and what I see is a WordPress like model, and this is where I think Jack was headed, that the base unit of either activity pub or at as protocols are open. Cuz they're protocols, but then there are commercial entities on top. And this is where it goes to what Alex was saying, that I can pay someone for a moderation service. I can pay someone for a verification service. I can pay for the Disney five view of, of the web or whatever that, that I think we're gonna have like wordpress.com, a top wordpress.org.

Now, is that ad supported? We get back into that whole mess of attention based economies and all that crap. Is it paid for by users and then it's a matter of privilege. That's a problem too. And by the way, one other thing that came out at, at the Black Twitter summit, Leo know, to your point a minute ago, wa with verification, was that we had a couple of sex workers there who are the leading edge of harassment online by Officialdom and the world. And they don't want their names verified. Right. They don't want their names out there for very good reason.

So if you were gonna start from scratch, Alex, last question. You've probably been asked this before. What would you do if you were gonna start from scratch, presuming that we need somewhere, we need a some sort of public entity that is the you know, you know, the speaker's corner, the, I mean, there's a lot of different things that this fulfills.

      "And, and it is used for that. And I have used it for that. I, I use it mostly for educational purposes. Right. So when I teach wifi in my fall class is about cybersecurity. Yeah. My spring class is about trust and safety. But in the fall, I, I teach a cyber class and I do a demo where I intercept people's connections and pull up. One of the interesting things you could do with it is, you know, so you're, you're the fun professor, <laugh>. Yes. My, my ratings my, my reviews are really good until I get fired. Right? Like, that's the <laugh>\n",
      "(01:19:40):\n",
      " I think that's the <inaudible>. So one of the cool things it does is, you know, so many people don't really understand, is that when you add a device to a wifi network and it remembers it, it will beacon for that. It will look for the beacon in the future. So your computer is effectively constantly saying, Hey, anybody here at Starbucks? Hey, anybody here is naming my home network? And such. So like, one of the fun demos I do is while I'm giving the wifi lecture, I'm sniffing in the background. Of course, all of the students, there's about 200 students in that class. They all have laptops open. 90% of them are probably not paying attention. Something again, I can figure out with the wifi pineapple <laugh> and Uhuh,\n",

And you have people raising their hand of like, that's my parents' network. That's the hotel I just went to and such. So it does all kinds of interesting stuff. Like one of the things you use it for is to pretend to be wireless network. So it has a radio that you can push perhaps a little bit beyond what the Ftcc says is a acceptable level of power output in the unregulated spectrum. And so what you can do is if you are in a, a public network, you can have it broadcast at a higher decibel level and take over and other, and people will associate to it. And then it will route all that traffic over. You can have it go over like a, a GSM card or an, you know, LTE or over a, you know hardwire if you have it. And then you can sniff all of that traffic.\n",

      "All stuff you can do with like a properly configured Linux laptop and such. But like, this just makes it all easy. And because it has its own cpu, you have your computer attached, you tell it what to do, and then you can walk away and you can leave it there. Yeah. So that's often, I we have used it for penetration test. You a good place for it, especially if you have a battery pack attached to it is the restrooms in the lobby. Right? So if you can use a restroom in a lobby of a building and they have a drop ceiling, you can go put it in the drop ceiling and let it Oh, geez. Take over wifi. So\n",

But this thing as, as, as Alex just explained, but let me say it. So Jeff, you were just at a hotel somewhere and using their wifi, you still have that in your list of wifis that you've accessed. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the pineapple can impersonate it and can be stronger than the coffee shop wifi. So your laptop without any, you know, talking to you will say, oh, hey, we're back at the hotel.

Right. They basically pen testing in trying to report vulnerabilities. So we've seen that level levied politically. So just my blanket comment here is, look, as a policy, I'm 100% white hat hacking. I think we need ways to indemnify people that are out there doing what I consider public service that's in the interest of national security. That's said, you know, if you look at the Pineapple Zero and some of the things you can do with it you know, you have people with no training whatsoever that can go unlock cars.

      "Leo Laporte (01:26:07):\n",

      "Leo Laporte (01:26:13):\n",

      "It's effectively, so it's not, it doesn't do wifi. Like you said, it's sub one gigahertz. There's a ton of spectrum used for IOT systems. Zigbee Laura is one. So there's a, there's a bunch of standards that people use for their gardening systems and their home alarm systems.\n",

      "Yeah, RF ID on your cards. This is effectively a super cheap version of the U S R P. Right? So like, we've had software defined radio for a while. They've often been very expensive. What these folks did is they built a software-defined radio platform. They limited its frequency range to, to make it cheaper and then put like a cool little gooey on it and create a community. So there's this community of people that you can download programs onto that a little SD card and, and pop it in. So I use the flipper zero, I demonstrate to my Stanford students, I copy one of their badges.\n",

      "Brianna Wu (01:27:28):\n",
      "Well, actually, can I say something about that really quickly? When I ran for Congress, one of the things I, I really got a crash course in is the way that large data and things like this I always say misused by police departments, but there's certainly asymmetric defense that can be done by police departments. Right? Because they do have the power to go and like Google your entire, like, history of your Android phone and find out everywhere you've been where the defense your defense that may be prohibitively you know, expensive. So it's really easy to see something like this. Like someone's stealing your badge and then like making it look like you're part of a crime. Right. Then how do you like go and prove your innocence there? I mean, it's, it's very easy to imagine scenarios and there's not a clear policy direction here forward because we don't wanna criminalize like, you know, pen testing and looking for vulnerabilities at the same time. This is something that has a tremendous capability for misuse. And I, I truly don't know where to go from here.\n",

      "This is cuz Modi wants to be able to control Yes. What news Indians get.\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:34:51):\n",
      "Yes. And, and WhatsApp is by far the most important platform. So India is a fascinating example that the most important social platform there is then encrypted, which is not true pretty much anywhere else. I mean, I guess except Brazil. Brazil, another, you're right. Another developing countries.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:35:06):\n",
      "And, and Brazil just went back and forth on WhatsApp. They Yes. They banned it\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:35:11):\n",
      "Briefly. They banned it. So one of the interesting things in Brazil is that individual, individual judges have a huge amount of power. So you end up with a situation where you have an individual judge ban WhatsApp or order the head of Facebook Brazil, who's a sales guy who has nothing to do with encryption, order him arrested. He's been arrested a couple of times. I think he has like a bag packed <laugh> in case he has to spend the weekend. Yeah.\n",

      "Poor\n",

      "Guy. So\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:35:34):\n",
      "Oh, actually Telegram was banned is not, not WhatsApp, but Telegram was banned in Brazil. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then, and then, and then another judge said, oh, nevermind. <Laugh>. Yeah.\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:35:43):\n",
      "And, and this is a, a, a constant thing in Brazil is the legal system, you know, it comes to a eventual consistency, but it there's a big packet\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:35:50):\n",
      "Forth it. Yeah. And then they were telegram was banned because th they the messaging company denied requests to reveal the personal data of users who had been sharing extremist hate messages. Yeah. So protecting the identities of their users, they got banned. And then another judge says, well that's too, that's draconian. We don't have to ban them. Right. telegram has said we might have to leave Brazil, but that's the problem with all this UK\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:36:20):\n",
      "One though, like you said, is end in encryption and you've had WhatsApp signal both say, we will not comply. So you're, you're going to end up Wikipedia is not the important one. What's happened Signal or on that's huge collision course with the UK\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:36:30):\n",
      "Government. Yeah. and, and so what ultimately if the UK insists WhatsApp and Signals say, bye-bye. We don't, how do you say goodbye to a country?\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:36:41):\n",
      "You could block 'em. I mean, you could block, you know, WhatsApp is based upon phone numbers, so you could block all the plus four, four s. Right. numbers you could ask for. You could go into the app store and be de-list yourself. You could geoblock based upon IP address. There's a variety of options. Yeah. you certainly can technically do it. I, it is something that Facebook has threatened before but never done. I think Google has threatened it, but has never done. And this might be, this might be the change because this is not a situation in other situations, the companies have threatened it because of a law they don't like. But it's been something often that they can follow without breaking the entire world. In this case, if you break encryption there, you break it everywhere, right? Like WhatsApp would have to rebuild their app, they'd have to build back doors. And so there's realistically no way to do it. And in doing so, they'd almost certainly break the law everywhere else cuz they've made a bunch of promises in Europe, in the United States and such, under which they're being held to. And so there's, I I don't think any good way for them to follow the UK law without being in breaking the law in a variety of other important jurisdictions.\n",
      "Brianna Wu (01:37:43):\n",
      "And I want to, I agree with that. I also wanna say the, the fight is here beyond services. It actually comes down to hardware as well. I was on a b BBC panel recently talking about when it comes to basically wire wireless communication protocols when we move to a new protocol, you know, China has some very different views on encryption and privacy than, than we do here in the United States. And the government's ability to get in there and look at things, right, the tendency is always going to be for governments to agree with the protocol that, you know, allows intelligence and law enforcement mm-hmm. <Affirmative> to, to look at that. So when we are seeding a role with this, you know, China ends up building a lot of these things. So it, it's gonna have long term effects on all of this. So, you know, it, it is just a very, very troubling shift in public policy. One I think could really get dystopian\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:38:42):\n",

      "Alex Stamos (01:38:52):\n",
      "That's true. I, I've been saying that like, at, and I said that to you, European, European parliamentarians do not like to hear that <laugh> <laugh>. But it, it is absolutely true that like over a a, basically there's a 90 day period over that 90 day period at the time, about a billion people ended up with full protection of all of the content that they're sending to\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:39:13):\n",
      "One another. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. How, what a what a difference something simple like that can make. Yeah. well the battle, you know, we've been talking about this for years now, you know, because the FBI's been demanding back doors and so forth, and there doesn't seem to be any resolution. There seems to be just two opposing parties and with no good answer in between. Right? There's no way to do this that doesn't jeopardize other people's security and privacy. So\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:39:42):\n",
      "There are options for end, end encrypted products to provide more safety for people. And unfortunately folks in the government side never consider those.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:39:51):\n",
      "What are those? Is it a key escrow system of some kind, or? Yeah,\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:39:54):\n",
      "So without key escrow, which is really a, a type of backdoor, you can have better reporting systems, right? So that's something that WhatsApp has invested in that they still could do a lot of work on, is helping people who are the targets of abuse to report that and to deal with. But how\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:40:08):\n",

      "A hash or something\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:40:19):\n",
      "Messenger. Exactly. It's called a franking code. So there's a, a mechanism, so somebody can't fake it. So you can't create fake csam or something and send, oh my God, the send person, I'm getting this, I'm getting this. You can cryptographically verify that it came from that\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:40:31):\n",
      "Person. The, the server can say, oh yeah, it's the same message. Right?\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:40:33):\n",
      "Because it's signed with the public key effectively of the person who sent it. Ah, right. So every, every message is signed and encrypted. Well,\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:40:39):\n",
      "That's a good way to handle it. Yeah.\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:40:40):\n",
      "And so you could do that. You can, one of the things I'd like to see companies invest in, and I've been advocating this, we, we ran a number of events at Stanford where we brought people together to talk about this. And unfortunately the companies have not made more direction here is on pushing a bunch of the classifiers and other trusted safety functionality into the client, right. Where it has to be decrypted. So if you are getting a bunch of death threats, or say you're a woman online, like a woman who, if there's any way to contact her, she will get unwanted pictures of male genitalia will say, right. That is a common thing that happens. And so you could have a classifier that if a man you don't know sends you a, an image that it's like, oh, I know what this is and it blurs it and it says, did you want this person to send you male genitalia? And you say No. And it automatically blocks the person and reports it to the platform. It does not have to. Wow.\n",

      "And they're implementing that now. They are implementing that for, for parents. Primarily\n",

      "Well they were talking about two different things. There was the Csam scanner. Yes. Which they have now abandoned. And I think that a lot of privacy advocates, including you, Alex said, that's a, that's a not gonna work. But this parental thing is, is very different. Right. but I want to hear Brianna's objection. Well, I just wanna make sure, Brianna, you're making the distinction between the two. Cause I agree with you about the first, but, well,\n",
      "Brianna Wu (01:42:27):\n",
      "I was talking about the Apple system where they came forward, and you're right, they did abandon it, but they were looking at basically scanning your photos and then basically alerting parents.\n",

Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what you can do is you could say this, this account basically can't send or receive naked photos and I message Sure. And that is a client side classifier.

      "But the same kind of idea can be extended. I mean, that's just one purpose, right? It can be extended to, if you're an adult and somebody sends you a death threat that that's classified on the client side, you have no relationship with that person. And you don't have to see that content for it to say to you, Hey, somebody sent you something hateful. Would you like to report it without seeing it? And that's kinda\n",

      "It's, it's fine. But I'm saying death threats, I have no faith that machine language is ever gonna be really able to crack down a harassment cuz it's so context dependent. Yeah. The things, there're just a million ways to talk around it or to not trip those things. So I, I just, I, I think every single social media network, including Facebook has tried to automate these processes with machine learning and sematic context analysis and, you know, all these various ways and it's great. It saves money, but I think it really comes at the expense of, of, of accuracy in my view. Which Yeah,\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:44:20):\n",
      "Because I think you have to work on the reporting side for end to end, that you have human beings Yeah. Look at the reports and then you ban people from the end to encrypted network.\n",

      "Yeah, that makes\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:44:27):\n",
      "Sense. Harassers have learned that an overt threat is actionable. But you can, you can couch it in such a way that it's not actionable, but the recipient knows perfectly well what you're saying. Yeah. And those things are hard to detect cause it's nuanced.\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:44:41):\n",
      "Right? So there are things you can do. The, the problem, the hardest thing to stop and any of these is a conspiracy between consenting adults, right? If you have adults who wanna do something illegal, usually end an encryption, whether that they're planning a terrorist attack or they're trading CS a m, that is the hardest thing because there's not a participant in the conversation who will report it, right? Because they're, they're both part of the conspiracy, and that's what the UK wants. And I think that's just something that we can't solve while also providing privacy. And so I think we have to choose to provide people privacy, agree. And we can focus on the other kinds of abuse types where there's a victim who's part of the conversation and protect them.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:45:19):\n",

      "Yeah, there was less\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:45:28):\n",
      "Pushback on, on that.\n",
      "Brianna Wu (01:45:30):\n",
      "Yeah. I, I'm only hearing it here. Like this implementation. I'd need to read more about it from, from the way you've described it. It makes sense to me. But I think we all know what these kinds of policies, the details really, really, really, really matter. And it also really matters. You know, is there auditing, is there oversight? Are you reporting stuff to government agencies? I mean, there, there's a lot of stuff here to critically think through.\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:45:53):\n",
      "So you can read about it. They call it communication, safety and messages. Apple as usual, has a pretty good white paper on it. But basically they're saying messages now includes tools that warn children, warn children directly and provide helpful resources if they receive or attempt to send photos that may contain nudity it blurs the photo before it's viewed on your child's advice. Provides guidance and age appropriate resources to help them make a safe choice, including contacting someone they trust if they choose. Yeah. that doesn't, that's good. Doesn't block it. Yeah. I think it's kind of, apple has, I think, been very responsive to the concerns they've heard and are trying to find a way that works. And it seems like a good system. You know, parents have to turn it on too. It's not gonna just happen. One, one\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:46:44):\n",
      "Of the problems is when they had their first version of all this, they kind of did a very thing, which is they did it all in house. They have the smartest people in the world there. We can figure this out from first principles. And because they didn't want, they never worked with anybody on outside of Apple. Right? Like in trust and safety and cybersecurity. It is extremely hard to work with anybody at Apple. And so they, they didn't talk to anybody. They came out, they just busted through the wall, like the Kool-Aid man with like, here's a c a m scanning tool Yeah. And all this stuff. And it was not a great\n",

      "Right. And so they did a whole listening tour. I know they talked to a lot of folks. They actually visited us at Stanford Good. And chatted with them and Good, good. I know they talked to a lot of child safety advocates and, you know a variety of advocates for, for different equities. And I think this is the, the compromise they came up with.\n",

      "I ask?\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:47:32):\n",
      "No, not anymore. Mm-Hmm. So, Mike, if you look at the NCMEC reports, it's actually kind of stunningly small, which is one of the things they're trying to deal with is that Facebook reports about 22 million pieces of CS a m per year. And the last one I saw, I think Apple had like 200. Right. Which is, it's hard to think about. Like, there's, there's not 200 bad anything on a billion user network, right? Like the, the step, the first step for something bad happening is 10,000. Right? Right. And so what that 200 is, is actually a big question for a lot\n",

      "Of folks. Yeah. Where'd those come from?\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:48:03):\n",
      "One of the theories is it's, it's csam m that's been sent via the iCloud email. Right. Right. Which would be a silly way to do it. And therefore that I've heard a couple of these of like, what services does Apple have that are unencrypted that people could move images around\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:48:15):\n",
      "This just for you, Brianna, is what the screen looks like. This is from Apples website. If I were to send or you were to send a child a sensitive photo, the photo is blurred. Then there's a message that pops up, says you're not alone and can always get help from someone you trusted with trained professionals. You can also block this person and you're given a choice of message, a grownup ways to get help block contact or cancel. And so if you wish or view the photo Yeah. If you wish, you can cancel and view the photo if you said, oh, no, no, I know what that is and I want to see it. But I think this is a, I I like this. Yeah, that\n",
      "Brianna Wu (01:48:50):\n",
      "Makes a lot sense. Yeah. That,\n",
      "Leo Laporte (01:48:52):\n",
      "That seems problem. This is a good way to do it. And I think it solves that problem. It doesn't solve the csam issue, but that's a very difficult issue.\n",
      "Alex Stamos (01:48:59):\n",
      "It's very difficult. And it's, the mass trading of Csam is, is mostly not an end-to-end encrypted messenger issue because WhatsApp, iMessage are not the best ways to move huge amounts of csam. The best way to do that is via encrypted, like locker the Megas a variety of dark websites and, and, you know, tour hidden services and such. Yeah. so it's yeah. I, I think, but the, one of the problems is law enforcement, like they, their hammer is lawful access to content. Right? Like, that is, all they understand is I have access to your text messages, I can prosecute you. And so everything's a nail. Yeah. Even if there's other more subtle technical solutions in place. Right.\n",

Thank you. This week in tech is brought to you by Noom. So one of the other things we did while we were overseas is eat a lot of TTOs and croissants and panel shola. I had some Kao pepe, I had some pasta carbonara. And, you know, we got back, and both Lisa and I are going over to this scale going, oh boy.

Num first time numerous lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks. But, and I didn't, I have to say I did not follow any particular prescriptive diet in Europe. I said, I'm gonna eat what I want. But one of the things that works about Noom is it's, it's not a diet, it's a psychology based approach. Believe me, I have done every fad diet known to man.

I get home from work and I start stuffing my mouth. We're watching TV and make a big thing of popcorn. And it just, it's not that I can't do that anymore. I, you know, I still love my popcorn. But, but Noom helps us be aware. And when you're aware, suddenly it's a lot easier to make good choices. Even when you're faced with Ka cho Peppe.

It's nourishing, not restrictive. It focuses on progress, not perfection. You can, they've got all kinds of levels of support. You can log your food, you can do the weigh-ins, you can have an individual coach. You can have a group five minute daily check-ins, personal coaching, whatever works for you. The lessons are great. You can really learn a lot from those lessons. I spent about 15 minutes a day cuz I wanted to learn more. First time, numerous, as I said, lows, an average of 15 pounds of 16 weeks. Nine.

I was down in Disney for the last two weeks. Oh. And you just, I I, the the way it works is it changes. It makes you just aware of what you're eating. So you don't, like, you make very deliberate choices. Deliberate, right? Yep. So if I'm gonna have like the caramel popcorn, I love it. Epcot, I can do that. I just need to like, not make other crazy choices during the day that make my calorie budget explode. It gets to a point, like, your body doesn't want the garbage. Like, I've not had Exactly.

I thought very, very good article in the New Yorker saying there's no such thing as ai. What Ai really, what we're seeing anyway, the AI we're seeing today is really more of a collaboration between humans. Everything it says, everything it draws is based on stuff. It, its basically mashing together from humans.

Open AI had said, well no, we're very careful about privacy. I think they reassured the regulators. They fulfilled, according to the ap, a raft of conditions that the Italian data Protection authority wanted satisfied. And so the ban was lifted, but it ain't over until it's over.

Which there's been a number of stories of people being misrecognized and arrested. Some pretty sad stories there. But yeah, the AI thing, the interesting thing I think for Europe and AI companies is Europe has such a big focus on effectively the right to be forgotten.

So they got a huge amount of free play for, for this ad of, of people criticizing it. Not, they're not, I don't think they're the folks who invented that little political trick, right. Of having a controversial ad that you put $10 behind, but you get a, a a million dollars in free airplay. But you know, it's not gonna be next time declared by, by the R N C with a little disclaimer of on the bottom as well as who paid for it. There's no reason why you can't do that on a individualized basis. And you can have, you know, those kinds of ads be going out to much, much smaller groups.

That's the kind of thing that you could build upon what people did in 2016 and 2020 and really Yeah. Shoot their stratosphere. Cuz you no longer have to have somebody creating the art, creating the script. If it's all automated, you could test 10,000, a hundred thousand ads and then find the 10 that work in those 10 different segments and then put all your money behind them.

They get, because when you put something out there that people don't like, they report it, that triggers Facebook's algorithm, they take it down even if it's a hundred percent compliant. And then you're waiting for a human to step in and then your news cycle has, has gone by. The problem is if you've started putting stuff out that AI had done, eventually the AI is gonna turn out stuff that is going to violate the Facebook terms of service. It's definitely gonna get reported and your entire account is going to be banned. So I think this is where Facebook's aggressive policies on political advertising, as much of the headaches as they cause me, I do think they would, they would make this a very difficult scam to pull up.\n",

So the, the team that I helped start did a little bit to start and then that really grew for the 20 18, 20 20, 20 22 elections is being decimated by layoffs.

So there are, there are still good people who are trying it, but I just proportionally I know that these teams have been, this is where a lot of the savings are coming from. Like, they, they just, you know, they, they cut a bunch of money. They, they're rewarded in the, the stock market cuz without revenue going up, profitability. Right. Went back up.

Democracy. Democracy, democracy. Every single time I get a chance nowadays to go talk to a Republican on a show, I really try to make that the point of view that we're coming back around and agreeing on.

Democracy was something that you did not want. It was said out loud. That was the point. And on certain places, I think in this country, now we're getting to that point where the major public radio station did some research recently, and they found in their audience that the word democracy is a turnoff.\n",

And what's weird is I thought this had been decided already with Trump back in 2021. It turns out that it was mooted because Trump got outta office. Right. So the Supreme Court did not have to decide that Trump had blocked some people on Twitter. A lower court said that violated their free speech rights and he had to unblock them. Supreme Court never did decide that. So now they're gonna have a chance to decide that they've got actually two competing decisions from lower courts. One said yes, one said no.

      "No. This is more demands for both data and for censorship.

Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg, all of his money was actually tied up like in a Chinese pharmaceutical company, right. <Laugh>, like that's effectively what you've got here. And you know, Twitter, despite all the talk about free speech, has actually complied at a much larger number of times, a bot turn over data and censorship on behalf of a number of countries. And I think India is the most interesting one here. Because India is going into an election year as well in 2024. Modi is consolidating power using a variety of different legal means. And whether or not American companies allow that to happen on their platforms is something they're gonna have to really consider. Obviously there's, there's huge downside. He already blocked TikTok. So he has demonstrated that he is willing to take very aggressive action against companies that make him angry. And it looks like Twitter has heard that message\n",

      "Yes. They're getting more requests. I think people see it as a new opening. Countries see it as a new opening.

I look at you know, when the Twitter files were released I do believe Twitter's chief council quit. I know they've lost legal resources across the board and, you know, you can say a lot to criticize Apple, but they sure went toe to toe with the F B I and dedicated, like, they put both their reputation and a lot of money on the line, like doing the right thing for user privacy here. And I think when you have a steward like Elon Musk, who, you know, his bottom line is not to any principle, it's to stop Twitter from hemorrhaging money. I think it's entirely unsurprising.
