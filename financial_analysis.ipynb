      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Based on the latest market trends and news for EPAM Systems Inc. (EPAM), here are the best execution methods for the approved trading strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Trend Identification and Entry Points**: The recent reports from Yahoo Finance show that EPAM's Q2 earnings and revenues beat estimates, reflecting a strong performance despite a slowdown in IT spending. This suggests a potential upward trend. Traders should look for entry points when there is a positive divergence in stock movement compared to general market trends, as seen in recent earnings outperformance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Stop Loss Placement**: Given the volatile nature of the current tech sector, setting a tight stop loss slightly below the recent support levels (e.g., a 5% drop from recent lows) could protect from sudden downturns.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Trailing Stops**: Implementing trailing stops could be ideal during this period of recovery and growth in IT services, as seen in EPAM's adoption of new technologies and market expansion. A trailing stop of 5-10% below the market price can help lock in profits while providing room for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management and Diversification**: With the overall uncertainty in the IT sector, diversifying across other robust performing tech stocks and sectors recommended by analysts can mitigate risks. Holding positions in different sectors will spread out potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitoring and Adjustments**: Continuous monitoring of EPAM's quarterly performance, and significant news updates are crucial. Adjustments should be made based on the company's forward guidance and market conditions, which currently show mixed signals with a slight decline in revenue outlook but strong AI adoption and IT service demand.\n",

      "Final Answer: EPAM Systems Inc. recently reported a decline in sales by 2.0% year over year to $1.15 billion, although this still beat the analyst consensus estimate. The adjusted EPS of $2.45 also surpassed expectations. However, the operating margin decreased to 10.5% from 12.3% in the prior year, primarily due to increased compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues. Adjusted income from operations declined by 8.5% Y/Y. This suggests a negative impact from a slowdown in IT spending due to the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment.\n",
